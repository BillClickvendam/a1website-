Over a decade ago, when our company was still known as AeroSpace Studios in Broadhurst Taung, Gaborone, Native Flex's genius and passion for music were key to our growth and transformation.<br><br><br><br>Native Flex's incredible journey in the music industry began with his formation of the group Tribe Soul alongside his close friend and protégé, DJ Enton. As a mentor, Native Flex guided DJ Enton, sharing his vast knowledge and shaping his talent. Tribe Soul was more than just a musical duo; it was a testament to their deep friendship and shared vision.<br><br><br><br>In time, Native Flex's influence helped expand the team by bringing another prodigious talent into the fold—Ma_EAzzy. This trio, united by their love for music and driven by Native Flex's inspirational leadership, was instrumental in realizing the vision for what would become A1 Media Production Group. Their collaboration marked a new era, transitioning from AeroSpace Studios to a powerhouse in media production.<br><br><br><br>Native Flex's legacy is woven into the very fabric of A1 Media. His contributions went beyond just production; he instilled a culture of excellence, creativity, and camaraderie. Even as we mourn his absence, we celebrate his enduring impact on our company and the music industry in Botswana.<br><br><br><br>The lessons he imparted, the music he crafted, and the relationships he built continue to inspire us. Native Flex's spirit lives on through the work we do at A1 Media Production Group, as we strive to honor his memory by achieving greater heights and nurturing new talents, just as he did. His story is a cornerstone of our history and a guiding light for our future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
